# BadgeMaker
A C# console app that creates employee security badges for an expanding company using the .NET framework.

# Features 
* When appplication is launched in the command line using "dotnet run" it will ask if you would like to create badges using data from the random user generator API or create a custom badge.
* If you enter yes, to use the random user API, it will create ten sample badges with a unique name, ID, and photo.  
* If no is entered you will be prompted to fill out the employee's name, ID, and photoURL. once those are filled out it will take you back to name if you want to add another user, if not you just hit enter when the space is blank and your custom badge(s) will be created.
* If anything except for "yes" or "no" is selected in the original prompt you will be asked to enter a valid response.
